# Offline AI

## Introduction
Offline AI is an application that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) without an internet connection. This project aims to bridge the technology gap, as internet access remains a challenge in Sierra Leone. By allowing on-device interaction with an LLM, users gain the ability to perform language processing tasks such as text completion, translation, and question answering offline, enhancing accessibility and privacy.

This example demonstrates how to build an Android app with TensorFlow Lite to run a local LLM. Weâ€™ve customized the approach to help you set up Offline AI for use on your device, and we include model optimization suggestions to reduce memory usage and improve processing speed.

## Quickstart Guide
Follow these steps to set up Offline AI:

1. Clone the Offline AI project.
2. Download the model file from [model download link] and save it to your local system.

### Steps for Setup

1. In your project directory, navigate to `android/app/src/main/`.
2. Create a new folder called `assets` if it doesn't already exist.
3. Move the downloaded model file into the `assets` folder. 
4. You can now build and run the Offline AI app on your Android device.
